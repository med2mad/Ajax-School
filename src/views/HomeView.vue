  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Welcome to "AJAX Heavens".</p>

  <p>This web site's goal is to show off my technical skills by using the excuse 
  of comparing some AJAX technique tools.
  <br>
  The web site also concentrates on bragging about styling skills 
  (looks and animations).
  <br>
  So in the end the web site has nothing 
  to do with anything, it's just a miserable try to impress the ladies (how sad!  -_-').
  </p>

  <p>
    So...amm......enjoy ^ ^ . <br>

  <h2>What is What ?</h2>
  <p>AJAX, is a web developpement technique, to manipulate data asynchronously, using javascript (and XML but no one does any more, we use JSON instead).</p>
