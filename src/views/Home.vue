  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Welcome to "AJAX Heavens".</p>

  <p>This web site's goal is to show off my technical skills by using the excuse 
  of comparing some AJAX technique tools.
  <br>
  The web site also concentrates on bragging about styling skills 
  (looks and animations).
  <br>
  So in the end the web site has nothing 
  to do with anything, it's just a miserable try to impress the ladies (how sad!  -_-').
  </p>

  <p>
    So...amm......enjoy ^ ^ . <br>

  <h2>What is What ?</h2>
  <p>AJAX, is a web developpement technique, to manipulate data asynchronously, using javascript (and XML but no one does any more, we use JSON instead).</p>
  <p>The app also shows the diffrence between sync and Async requests, and calculates the time that takes each of them to move forward (not the actual request time), which shows the superiority of the Asynchronous  way.</p>
